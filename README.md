Come on GitHub JavaScript
=========================

A Google Chrome browser extension that sends a more recent Chrome User-Agent
when accessing GitHub.

GitHub doesn't send JavaScript to browsers that it deems too old to
support:

![Please note that GitHub no longer supports your web browser
message](./screenshot.png)

I don't care if some of it errors, but I would like the JavaScript please.
